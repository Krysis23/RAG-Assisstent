870.9, "end": 892.9, "text": " music"}], "text": " In this video, we will know what are forms and what is the input tag in the form. Using a form is a very important element of some websites because through the form, you submit data from client to server. These are the forms that you see on contact pages, Google forms or inquiry forms. The date and time to go to the flight or railway ticket, we put all these details, they also submit through the HTML forms. In the last video, very few people liked it, I will request you to like this video with high energy so that we can maintain high energy throughout the course. So let's go to the computer screen, we will see about the forms, we will see about the input tags and we will see some best practices. Let's roll the intro. So guys I have come to my computer screen and now see I am going to make a folder here which I am going to name video6 because this is the sixth video. I will do it with open with code, I have already told you all this. And here I am going to make index.html and I will put an exclamation mark in it and what I will do is I will wrap the view word, I will turn on the screen cast mode and you will see here I will write forms let's learn it. So I have set the title of this forms page here and what happened by setting the title that the title will be visible on our page. Here I want to tell you a very important setting, show preview, many of you have pointed out to me in the comment that you have to click so many times, can you do something? Yes you can, click on the gear below, click on settings and after clicking on settings, what you do simply, write live preview here and we can actually set it such that whenever we click, it will open on the external browser. So now I will close everything, as soon as I click here, it will open on the external browser and I come to my browser and the playlist of the Sigma web development course is accessing it by clicking on the star and here on the bookmark. But now I want to tell you that as soon as we click here, you see it opened, so if you want this, then do this, but sometimes what happens is that you want to prefer side by side view and when you want to do that, when you are actually working on a design using HTML, CSS. So whenever you are working on design, you definitely want to see live previews here, which is why this extension was made and it was made different from the live server so that you can see the preview on the side. Now what we will do here, we will know about the forms, what is a form, you know the name, the form means that we fill the railway form and with that our reservation is done, along with that we fill the form of IIT JEE, the form of NEET, the form of any exam, so that our data can reach those who want it, so this is the form. HTML is a form tag, as soon as you enter the form, you will get the first question from you, what is the action of your form, get or post, I tell you a very quick difference between get request and post request, get request is a very simple request and post request is sent when we have to give a lot of data, like when our form is posted, then in most of the cases we will use post request and get request is a very simple request. Post request is that we have to tell the server something and that's it or we have to hit the server with a request but if you did not understand this now, that should be fine, there is no problem, because we will do this in detail later, so the form action is equal to post I have written here, now I can show some input tags inside it, input tag what are they, that what elements will come inside your form, like you can put a date, you can put in the form that tell me your name, you can say tell me your phone number, you can say what is your age, it can be just a number, you want to put such things in the form, so I want to tell you here that the input tag which you put inside the form and there is a label tag which is used to label that input, so what I will do here, you see the simplest input tag is type is equal to text, so I will put the type is equal to text input here and you see here, if I zoom out and show you, so see here input type is equal to text, name is equal to username, placeholder enter your username and it will look like this, you can say here enter your username and the user in front of you will have to enter the username, I will write an H1 here and I will write here assume form to apply for TA for sigma web dev TA, sigma web development course TA, assume we are hiring teaching assistants for sigma web development course, so we can write something like this here, by the way I have put subtitles, if you have not accessed the playlist, then do access it and along with that I will show you one more thing, so these subtitles are very funny, I will show you, write sigma batch op and your village land and give your village land to me, means someone is watching English, or someone is watching who does not know Hindi at all, he will say, brother, what happened so far and give your village land to me, I like this a lot, anyway now you can see here that I have put H1 here, which is our heading, this is our main heading, enter your username, this is our input tag, along with the input tag, we use the label tag, now whose label is this, so for is equal to I will write its ID, means I will write its ID username and what will I do in for is equal to, I will put its ID in for is equal to, now what is this ID, I will tell you later, for now you just understand that it is a unique identifier of an element, to identify this element uniquely, like your Aadhar number cannot be anyone else, in the same way, it has got this ID username, now it cannot be anyone else, this is the ID, I will tell you more in detail later, but for now understand this, so I wrote label for is equal to username, I wrote this input and you can see here that the label will come here, so I am seeing here, I have not put anything in the label actually, so I will put enter your username, and you can see that as soon as I put this here, you will get to see here, enter your username, after this you can enter your username, along with that you can enter your expertise here, you can put anything, suppose I want to ask here what is your gender, so I can do something like this here, and you can see enter your gender, and as soon as I did this, I can ask you what is male or female, now what happens here is that sometimes we wrap this in div, what is div, div is our block element, and what are inline and block elements, I have not told you in this course yet, but I will tell you in the coming videos, so for now you just understand that I am putting this in div to give a new space, so as soon as I put this in div, it will come in a new space, yes there is also a br tag, there is also a br tag with which line break comes, but I don't prefer br tag, and you will get to know why, why we don't want to bloat our html with br tag, you will get to know this in the coming videos, now you see here enter your username, here male or female, now you see here as soon as I click on female, this radio button is selected, I am clicking on male, this is selected, why is this happening, because the label of this, I have put for is equal to female, and here I have put id female, and along with that, I have put the name of both of them, here name is equal to gender, I have put this input tag, and name is equal to gender, I have put this input radio tag, and as soon as we have written type is equal to radio, it means this is a radio button, and if we have made the name of this same, then only one of these can be selected at a time, that is, if I select this, then only this will happen, if I select this, then only this will happen, now I will show you one thing, if I mess up the id in the form of the label, and here also in the form, I don't mess up the first one, and if I mess up the second one, then when I click on the female of the second one, see it will not be selected, I am clicking, it is not getting selected, I am clicking on male, it is getting selected, so to select the female, I will have to click on this, are you seeing, so what I should do, always for is equal to, the input tag, its id should be put, so you can see, here I have put the label for is equal to female, along with that, we have an input tag, which is type is equal to check box, now see here, if I put the input of type is equal to check box, I will do this work by putting it in div, and when I do the format document by right clicking, our document will be very good, that is, its formatting, indentation, etc. will be very good, now see here, here subscribe to newsletter, here I can check it, and the difference between radio button and check box is, that you can check the check box, different check boxes, here if you want male or female, or any of the options, you can select it like this, after this we have text area, and select tag, and I will show you what it is, so text area, text area and select tag works like this, now here as soon as you copy the text area, and I will show you by putting it here, text area, so text area input type is equal to text, but it has rows and column attributes, which helps you to make its size small, now see here, the placeholder inside it, I have given, enter your comment here, so I have given enter your comment here, ideally, what we will do, we will keep it empty, or we will not give at least new line in it, so I will stick it here, enter your comment here, and now it will reach to the left side, so it has reached to the left side, enter your comment here, and any user can put his comment here, now see I have put the content of text area, enter your comment here, so ideally you will not want to do this, you will want to keep the text area empty, and you will want to put a label, and you can say label, for is equal to comment, and definitely we will put id here, whenever we put for, so inside for, the element for which it is, its id, now see here, enter your comment, if I write here, so what will happen, if I write enter your comment, if I write enter your comment, then enter your comment will come here, now you will say, this is not styled properly, this style is not properly, because we will style it with CSS later, for now I will put just br tag, but I don't recommend br tag, I am telling you again, I do not recommend br tag at all, because br tag has problems, by the way you should know br tag, it is line break tag, a line break comes from it, now you must be feeling everything right, you must be saying what is the problem in br tag, but I will tell you, br tag is something that I don't recommend, it is not that you don't have to use it, but I don't recommend using it all the time, means the easiest thing is, people think that put br tag, and keep adding new spaces, I oppose this thing a lot, so I will copy this, I will show you select tag, something like this, and you see here, as soon as I put select tag here, I put it inside div, so what happens in select, you get some options, the syntax of select is something like this, making apple and, you can use any of the three, now you see here, any of the three can be used, and what I did here, value is equal to apple, first I made select tag, in that name is equal to fruits, then option value is equal to apple, option value is equal to banana, option value is equal to cherry, when we will parse this form data, then I will tell you in javascript part, how to take this data and send it to server, so about form, there are many things that are remaining, I am going to tell you, so stay tuned for that, this was about forms, I wanted to tell you all the elements of form, in this video, and along with that, I have told you about select tag, and all these things, about form, the rest of the attributes, like action, I told you, you can submit form on any page, from action, and where will it handle, so you can give that data here, then there is a method, get request or post request, I will tell you the difference in these two, but I have told you in a very rough way, that get request is a very simple request, post request is used when, big data has to be sent to server, because get request has a limit, in post request, you can send a lot of data, in get request, we don't even send passwords, we send it with the help of post request, now here, I have told you the method, what happens in name, name is equal to username, means we mark it with name, if we mark it with name, then server will know, which key is corresponding to this value, so the key value pair, which will go to server, will go according to name, its name and value will go, so we will see this too, when we will do server side processing, what is the meaning of placeholder, placeholder means, what will be written inside it, like here, enter your username, placeholder is there, if I click on this, then enter your username, is not written inside it, if I will write anything, see it came, but enter your username, is telling me here, that I have to put username inside it, then after this, required means, you have to require it, you have to put its value, otherwise your form will not be submitted, so we will use this a lot, then after this, autofocus comes to us, what does autofocus do, autofocus automatically, focuses the cursor, so I will show you, the magic of autofocus, so if you have written here, autofocus in input tag, so I have written autofocus, in enter your username, now I will reload it, so if I type on this, then automatically, focus will be on it, so by autofocus, whatever you type, will be typed here, I hope you are understanding, these things, now validation attributes, here required, I have told you, you can give pattern, in which you can give regular expression, now don't get confused, don't say, what are you talking, we don't know regular expression, so I am sitting here, so I will teach you all things, but you understand, that we will accept only one pattern, if we have put pattern is equal to this, so you can't put anything, other than this pattern, so this thing, you should know here, so I hope, you are enjoying this video, and with that, in comment section, do write sigma batch op, and in first video, please review this course, because still many people, ask me, should I do this course, or not, free course, people don't value, they say this course is free, so should we watch this, or should we take paid course, and for those people, I would like to give a note, who said to me, that we have taken paid course, what should we do, should we collect that money, or should we join sigma batch, you should join sigma batch, cut your losses, and join sigma batch, because see, what is the quality of this course, I don't think, I need to tell you, so you should come and do this, you will get everything here, I am telling you, don't think that it is free, I was going to sell you this course, for 10,000 rupees, yes that was the amount, which we fixed, I was going to sell you this course, for 10,000 rupees, and I think there is nothing wrong, in selling any course, if anyone is selling, there is nothing wrong, in selling any course, but the thing is, if you have bought any other course, and you still feel, that sigma is a very good course, which is there, so you should join, cut your losses and join, because once you make your career, in future, you will not feel anything, in the coming time, if you look back, you will also say, yes, we took a paid course, then we took a free course, from which we understood, and once you make your career, then all these things, will not matter in the future, so do what is right for you, and you work while understanding, I hope you are understanding things, so like the video, access the playlist, subscribe to the channel, and in the comment section below, writing sigma batch op,
