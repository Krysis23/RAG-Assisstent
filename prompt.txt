I am teaching web development in my Sigma web devlopment course. 
Here are video subtitle chunks containing video title, video number, start time in seconds, 
end time in seconds, the text at that time:

[{"title":"Basic Structure of an HTML Website","number":"3","start":190.96,"end":192.28,"text":" This is the opening tag of the head."},{"title":"Basic Structure of an HTML Website","number":"3","start":420.12,"end":421.92,"text":" which tell about this tag."},{"title":"Basic Structure of an HTML Website","number":"3","start":325.52,"end":326.72,"text":" Now here is the head section."},{"title":"Basic Structure of an HTML Website","number":"3","start":188.56,"end":189.68,"text":" This is the opening tag of the body."},{"title":"Basic Structure of an HTML Website","number":"3","start":413.32,"end":415.12,"text":" This is inside any tag,"}]

----------------------------------------------
"where is head tag taught in this course"

User asked this question related to the video chunks, you have to answer in a human way 
(don't mention the above format, it's just for you) where and how much content is taught 
in which video (in which video and at what timestamp, convert the timestamp from seconds 
to minutes) and guide the user to go to that particular video. If User asks unrelated 
question, tell him that you can only answer questions related to the course.
