We saw in our very first video that we can embed videos in HTML. Today I will tell you how the video is auto-played, how to keep a muted video, and how you can enable and disable the video controls. Along with that, we will also see very closely about audio, how media can be shown in an overall page. So do like this video and stay in this video because the examples I have used for video tags are very amazing. Let's go to the video screen. Let's roll the intro. Intro Friends, this time I have made a folder named video10 and I will not waste your time by opening Open With Code by right-clicking. In fact, I will make it in index.html. And the topic of today's video is video. How to play a video, how to put a video in an HTML file, how to put audio, how to put media. So adding a video is very straightforward. I will copy it here, which is our video tag. It has an src attribute and it has some more attributes which I will discuss with you. But first of all, I want to tell you here that video src is equal to, you will write here, so if you have video.mp4, it will play. So let's see here, I have put it here by pressing ctrl. And I will click here and preview it. And you can see here that this video has come. Now this is a very big video. So what can I do? I can give its width. So I can say here width is equal to 555 pixels. And as soon as I do 555 pixels, in fact, I don't need to write px, I will just do 555. Like we don't need to write px in the image. Here too we will not need to write px. So as soon as I did width is equal to 555, in fact, I do one thing, I do height is equal to 555 so that it becomes smaller. In fact, I make it smaller, I do 255. And you see it came here. Now I play it because I have pressed ctrl, I can play it. What did you say? It's a better road than America. What did you say? What's your name? Gopindra Jogi. Where have you been in the US? I have been to many places in the US. Tell me your name. Gopindra Jogi. So the thing is that you can play the video like this. Now there are some attributes of the video tag here. See, it is very simple to use the video tag. You should have a video. You have given the path of the video. After that you have given the controls. So these controls will come to you. You can download it, you can do full screen, you can mute, you can do picture in picture. All this is automatically provided by your browser. But let me tell you about some attributes. The first attribute is src. So you know that put the video here. The name of the video file is src. This video file can also come from the external URL. Understand you people. That is, if I have uploaded a video on Amazon S3 or somewhere else, then I can also put the URL there. It is not necessary that the file is in your computer. It can be on your server. It can also come from the third party. Now what does the controls do? Adds video controls like play, pause and volume. Which we saw here in the video of Gopindra Jogi. That you are getting to see the controls here. Now what is this thing? The browser automatically sees what will be the control add in your video, what will not be. Then see what will autoplay do? It will automatically play as soon as the page is loaded. Okay. So if I put autoplay here, I put autoplay here. Okay. See what is happening. So you can see that it is autoplay here. So I will remove autoplay from here. And our next attribute is loop. That is, once our video is played, it will keep looping. Like I show you. So it started again. Once I finished it, it started again. So this loop works like this. The next attribute is muted. Muted mutes the video. So if I write here muted, sometimes we want the video to be muted. In fact, when I add videos here on codewithhari.com and I demonstrate something, like downloading VS Code or something, then I use the muted attribute. Because I don't want that when I record a video, if there is any background noise, you can hear it. For example, I want to show you that this is the element. So I will scroll and make a video. I will highlight it like this. So I don't need audio in it. So I mute it. So you can use the muted attribute in your website. Then the poster. The poster is very important. So I have an image here. Download.jpg. Okay. If I write here, poster is equal to and I write download.jpg, then you will see something like this. Okay. This is how the poster looks. Then I will play it. Then the video will play. So in a way, the thumbnail. Okay. The thumbnail of the YouTube video is shown. This is exactly the same. This is the poster attribute. So you can use all these attributes. Width and height. You know that it specifies the dimension of the video. Like I have added both width and height here. You saw. So I hope you understood this thing. Now, the thing I want to tell you after this is audio. So this is for all the attributes of your video. It is very straightforward. I want you to make a website. Which I am going to give you at the end of this video in a quick quiz. So listen to the quick quiz. In fact, I will put the heading here. Quick quiz. Okay. So that I don't forget. I will give you this now. And this is going to be a very interesting quiz. And everyone must solve it. But before that. As soon as you write audio, SRC comes here. And I have to put SRC in sachin.mp3. So as soon as I put it in sachin.mp3. Now see here. I will reload it. And the audio did not come here. Which is strange. Let's see what the problem is here. I put SRC is equal to. I have to write controls here too. So if I don't write controls, then I will not see the audio. See, now the audio has come. I can see the controls here. I can also set its volume. I play this audio. Sachin, what is in Sachin? Is it a fake Sachin? Okay. So this is our audio. If I mute it and run it, then it will not work. And I can also increase it further. Is it a fake Sachin? Okay. You people have seen. So this is an audio called sachin.mp3. Now what we will do is. We will see some attributes of this audio. SRC you know. Source of the video file. Okay. Then after this, you know the controls. Play, pause, and volume. Which we just saw. What will autoplay do? It will automatically play it. If I have here. Autoplay. Sachin, what is in Sachin? It will automatically play it. Is it a fake Sachin? So what happens by autoplaying? Our audio is automatically played. After this, the next attribute is loop. What will loop do? It will repeat it. If I want to loop it. So I have autoplayed it. Now I will loop it. Sachin, what is in Sachin? Is it a fake Sachin? Once. Sachin, what is in Sachin? Second time. Is it a fake Sachin? So you saw it was repeated. Means it was played once. Then it was played again. Because I had looped the audio. Okay. So you saw this thing. I looped Sachin.mp3. Means it was played once. Then it was played again. Then it was played again. Sachin, what is in Sachin? Okay. It was repeated. Because this MP3. It will be played again and again. So there are many cases. When you want this MP3. To be repeated. Okay. So if you want your MP3 to be repeated. Then you can use it. Now after this. Muted. What will it do? It will mute the audio. And definitely you don't want. By default, your audio is muted. In most of the cases. But. Sometimes we want. That the audio is muted. And we can tell the user here. Brother, whoever wants to listen. Unmute it. Sachin, what is it? When do we do this? When there are multiple audios. You want to show 5-6 audios together. You can mute them. The user can play and unmute. And watch. Okay. So you have control. If you want. You can use this thing. Okay. In total, this is the thing. So I hope you understood this thing. You must have enjoyed. Now preload. The most confusing attribute. That's why I have explained it. On codewithaddy.com. That the preload attribute. It can have these values. The first value can be none. This is the default value. It indicates that the browser. Should not preload the audio at all. Okay. Preload means. If you want. That the browser fetches the data. Then you will use the preload attribute. Otherwise you will not use the preload attribute. Okay. Preload is equal to none. It is the default value. Preload is equal to metadata. Means. That the browser only. Metadata. Means. The information about that audio file. It will preload it. Means it will load it from the beginning. And what will happen by doing auto. That the browser will preload. The entire audio. Okay. So preload is equal to auto. If I do. Then it will download. And automatically load. So that whenever the user plays it. Then the audio is saved. Okay. So. This is the work of the preload attribute. And in interviews. This preload attribute is asked a lot. So you should know. What is the preload attribute? Before moving forward. I want you to share this playlist. With your friends. Because I am seeing. That the interest is declining a lot. As we are moving forward in the videos. My request to you is. You like this video. And along with that. As you are forking this repository. You have to star it too. Okay. Your star. Your likes. All this will help me a lot. To bring such free courses. So this was about audio. And video tags. Okay. I have told you all the attributes. And you definitely. Use it. All these images. I will give you. So that you can try it out well. This thing. Now a lot of people were asking. Can we use replit? See in this course. I have not used replit. But replit.com is an amazing website. If you want. Use it in your phone. If you want to run html. There is a replit app. There is for iOS too. There is for Android too. So you can try it out. A lot of people are asking. How to do recording in the phone. Replit. But what I want now. VS Code. Which most of the people. Want to use. Prefer. So I thought. Why not make videos in VS Code. But I personally. Use replit a lot. Infact videos also come in replit. Next topic is SVG. Related to media. What is SVG? SVG is a format. With which you. Can create image. With high graphics. Vector images. So if you copy. You can basically make a circle. So SVG is used. In the same way. As used. Our IMG tag. So see if I put SVG here. So this SVG will come here. So see this circle and SVG. Came here. Video. Audio. SVG. These are inline elements. That's why we are getting. To see in one line. Okay. You have seen here. Now what is here. You can save the SVG file. You can save the SVG file separately. Like if I write here. That is img.svg. And save the content of SVG. So if I write here. Img. And I will write img.svg. So you guys see here. That I did not get to see this. If I write alt here. And write my svg image. So you see here. My svg image came like this. But I did not get to see SVG. Why did this happen? This happened because the SVG. I write svg file in browser. And when you want to see svg file in the browser. So you will put a declaration on top. I will show you. So I wrote here. svg file not showing. So here is a stack overflow answer. Which will tell you. So you have to write this. I will show you. xml. Something like this. You have to add this. This is called namespace declaration. So you have to add this svg. And now you guys see here. This svg is visible. So this thing is very important. And many people. In the future when you make websites. So you will definitely get stuck in this problem. I keep getting stuck. So I am telling you. That the problem in which you will get stuck. I told you before. You did not have a problem. I told you the problem. I told you the problem. And I told you the solution. The next topic is iframes. Iframes is also a very simple thing. That you can embed another website. In your website. Like if I want. I can embed this web page. So I can do it by using iframes. So see I wrote iframe this. And I will copy this url. And I will paste it here. And you guys see here. That this website is completely embedded. In this much iframe. You will definitely want. That you embed in this big iframe. But if you want. That it gets embedded. Then you can embed it like this. I will do one thing. I will increase its height a little. So width is equal to width. Width is equal to. Let me say 122. Height is equal to 444. Okay. So see it came like this. Now definitely it was coming in this width. So it came in this line. But if I increase the width a little. Let me increase the width. 322. Okay. So see this. My website is completely embedded here. You guys see. So you can embed a website. Another use case of iframe is YouTube video. If you want to share YouTube video.
