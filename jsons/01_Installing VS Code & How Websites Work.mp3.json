"text": " From today's video, we will start the Sigma Web Development course. Like this video with high energy, because in this video, I am going to make you a profitable web developer from zero. This course will be very modern because web development has changed over time. A lot of new things have come, a lot of things have come in JavaScript that make work very easy. A lot of technologies have come that will make your work very easy. This course will be for those people who know nothing. You know zero if this course is for you about web development. We will start from zero, but in the future we will raise the bar like anything. What will we learn in this course, I will tell you in a while. Web development is a very profitable thing. I have personally earned a lot of money through web development. And I believe that you can also be very successful by learning web development. During the course, you will be given notes, cheat sheets, references, all these things. This course is going to be a little different because I will tell you all the technologies that you should learn according to your experience in this course. And I will make this course a complete course with all the web development technologies. The course content will be complete web development, front-end, back-end, database. I will teach you as much as you want to learn. I will tell you what exactly the course content will be in a while. But you guys have faith that I will make you a full-stack developer. A lot of projects will be done for you in the course. And at the end of the course, we will make some good projects. So that your grip on web development can become very strong. According to me, project-based learning is the best way to learn. That's why I will make a lot of projects for you. And if you agree, then write in the comment section below, I agree. Because when you comment, I get a smile on my face. So do comment. I want to assure you that after finishing this course, you will be able to make any kind of website from start to end. And during this course, I will make a lot of websites for you so that your confidence will go up a lot. So let's start with the first video of our Sigma Web Development course. Let's roll the intro. Alright guys, so I have come to my computer screen. And now follow me as I am doing. I have downloaded the Google Chrome browser here. You also download the Google Chrome browser. I am not saying that it will not work. But you guys have to do exactly the same as a beginner. What I am doing here. So here we will follow exactly as I am doing. And as the videos come, you will be able to follow exactly. I will go to Google quickly. And I will write here. Download VS Code Now what is this VS Code? VS Code is a source code editor. If I am in Windows, then I will click on Windows. If you are in Mac, Linux or any other operating system. Then you can download it for that strange operating system. And the process will be exactly the same. You can see that VS Code has come here in my Downloads folder. And here you can see that this setup has been downloaded. I will refresh here. And here you can see that I can double-click the VS Code setup and install it. So simply install VS Code. It is as easy as installing a game. You read the agreement quickly here. This license applies to... Damages. And after this, I will accept the agreement. You also read it like me. And I am the fastest reader in the world. I am the fastest reader in the world. Next. It is important to check both icons here. It is very important to check both icons. If you want a desktop shortcut. That is, if you want to get a shortcut on the desktop. Click on the Create a Desktop icon. And after this, we will do the next. Then we will install. If your PC is fast like me, then it will be this fast. But if your PC is slow, then there is no problem. It will be a little slow to install. Nothing more than this will happen. Now here I will recommend you to subscribe to the channel. Because these videos. I want you to follow exactly. As soon as I put the video, you get a notification. So if you want to follow this course completely. Ideally, you should subscribe. With that said, our VS Code has been downloaded. I have opened my VS Code. Don't be afraid to see this. Beginners, don't be afraid to see this. And I am saying this again. If you already know things. We are taking a beginner-friendly start here. In the initial videos. But we will raise the bar like anything. In the upcoming videos. So stay tuned. Hi. Okay, I will request you guys. Tell me in the comment section. What is your level? Are you a beginner, advanced or an intermediate user? Tell me in the comment section. How much do you know about web development? Beginner, advanced, intermediate. Please, you guys do comment. Now what is VS Code here? Why did we download it? Let's understand this. So if you are a beginner. You don't know what VS Code is. Let me tell you that VS Code is a code editor. Which helps you to edit code. Now you will say. Harry, I can edit code in notepad. So yes, do it in notepad. It will also be done in it. Yes, I am not saying sarcastically. It will be done in it. Let's set it up here. And show what is in it. Which makes it a little different from notepad. Look here, let's set it up quickly. I will not browse here with color themes. In fact, I do it. I keep dark modern here. My theme. And I have done all this. Next section. After this, next section. If you want, you can also close this welcome. But again, here are some tips. Telling you. That's it. This is your VS Code here. It has started. This is the screen of VS Code. You can see. You can make a new file here. You can make a new folder. But I will recommend you guys. That you close it. Yes, you guys close it. Why did you close it? I am going to make a new folder here. And I am going to keep it in its name. You guessed it right. Sigma Web Development Course. And we will do everything in this course. We will do everything. We will do everything. Means understand. We will do related to the course. We will not do much. Now here you will press shift and right click. If you are in Windows. So you can see here. That an option called Open with Code is coming. This option called Open with Code. Helps you open this particular folder in VS Code. You will select it here. So what will you do here? You will say. Yes, I trust this file. Click on it here. Yes, I trust the authors. And this folder has now opened. Means if I click on plus. To make a new file. Suppose I have written here. Index.html Write it now. Even if you don't know what I am writing. Write it. Hit enter. And after this. What will I do? That I will write here. Hey, I am your first HTML file. Suppose I wrote this. Here you can see this dot. This dot is white in color. This dot means. That you have not saved this file. Please save it. Hit ctrl s. It will be saved. I will recommend you guys. Go to the file. Enable the auto save option here. So as you type. You will not see this dot. Your file will be saved instantly. As you type. And I also recommend this thing. We will not use ctrl s. Otherwise if you want. Save with ctrl s. Then you can disable this option. One more thing I want to do with you guys. Click on gear here. Then click on settings. And search here. Mouse. Mouse. Mouse. Now see here. Editor. Mouse wheel zoom. Check this. What will happen by checking this? Just check this. And close it in settings. Now you don't have to be afraid. What is VS code? Why is VS code? How is VS code? What is this? Why is this? What is this news? Yes. But you don't have to see all this. Now you press ctrl. Simply like this. If you scroll. So what happens? That your font size. It changes. Now I will show you a magic. What is magic? It is a very simple logic. That here in downloads. In the folder named. Sigma web development course. What happened? That this file was made. Index dot html. Which is very easy. You can do it. Which is very natural. Because I have opened this folder in VS code. Because I have opened this folder in VS code. This file is also made here. I will make another file here. Suppose I make a file named this.txt. In it I write. This is this. So what will happen? This file will be made here too. You can see. So this folder. And this VS code. Both are running in sync. Now if I open this file from here. From the notepad. And I show you. My file is opened in the notepad. So I can do that too. That is also my choice. But I will not use the notepad. Because VS code. Is not working. So I will not use it. Because VS code. Is not working. But I will not use the notepad. Because VS code. Is not working. And I want. That I get those features. And I want. That I get those features. I don't want to overwhelm you. But I show you. What is in VS code. What is in VS code. Which you don't get in the notepad. Which you don't get in the notepad. If I write here. Suppose. If I write here. If I write here. If I enter. Then it automatically. It gave me the opening and closing tag. If I hit the exclamation mark here. Then it gives me. A boilerplate template. A boilerplate template. If I click on it. Then see. The basic code of html. Will come here. We will discuss about it later. You don't get overwhelmed by it. You don't get overwhelmed by it. But I want to tell you. But I want to tell you. How it is useful. How it is useful. Why we didn't use notepad. Why we didn't use notepad. Why we didn't use VS code. And this feel. And this feel. We are getting. We are getting. The developer feel. The hacker feel. That feel is also important. That feel is also important. That is why. We will get confidence. To code. Now for mac and linux users. I want to comment here. Exactly. Similar things. For you. I am using windows. Because I have windows laptop. I can't use three laptops. I can't use three laptops. But I can't use little mac Windows at same time. But I can't use three laptops Windows at same time. So things will be similar for you. So things will be similar for you. In fact. I should say. Things will be similar. Not the same. Things will be very similar in fact. Things will be very similar in fact. Fine. So you will be able to follow along very easily. So you will be able to follow along very easily. So don't get tensed at all. So don't get tensed at all. I will tell about some extensions. For a while. And it will be fun for you while you use those extensions. And it will be fun for you while you use those extensions. and you will also say that it is fun, what a thing you have recommended but I will tell you in a while and this is criminally underrated I am telling you that you will enjoy before that I would like to tell you here you will right click, click on command palette so here a lot of options of VS code come you don't need to know all these options as we move forward in the course whatever feature will come in use I will keep telling you in the same way and you guys use it but now what I will do here I will toggle a screencast mode you don't have to do this but I will do it, you will know what will happen I clicked, so you see I will type anything if I press caps lock, then caps lock will come here so you will know which button I pressed now this thing is not at all relevant for you but I just want to tell you that the screencast mode the screencast mode we can change its settings from here now you see here screencast mode has vertical offset what does vertical offset mean if I make it 0, then it will come up if I make it 70, then it will come down I will make it 60 I will make it 60, if I give space then it will come here if I make it 80, then it will come here means from bottom how much it will look up, so I made it 0 in fact I made it 1 now whatever I type here, if I do this it will show you down, which is ideal so what I will do is I will close this .txt file I will close the settings tab these are tabs basically like chrome has tabs, these are exactly the same so I hope you know what it is what we have written about it you will forget, I will tell you step by step what exactly is it you can also close the welcome page of VS Code by any chance if you want to zoom in to VS Code, which I will do because I am recording a video now add control plus numpad plus see below I have shown you, I am zooming in I am zooming in because I am recording videos so ideally I would like you to see the screen from close but when I am doing my coding I don't zoom in so much so you have to keep this thing in mind so these are related to VS Code now I want to tell you how websites work, a website basically works through three types of people imagine three people, one is client one is server who is client, second who is server, third who is browser who is also called Babu bhaiya browser bhaiya so browser bhaiya, client bhaiya, server bhaiya what is client, what is server, what is browser, I am the client you, all of us who use a browser, who is the browser, this is chrome hello chrome, I am the client I will tell the client when I write codewithharry.com suppose I write codewithharry.com so what I basically say, I say from this browser that please give me codewithharry.com website or if I write here youtube.com I say give me youtube.com website I say, browser give me youtube.com, I want to watch youtube, what does the browser say you want youtube, take this so here I will enter youtube.com so from the server he brought youtube.com are you understanding, from the server he brought youtube.com and he parsed it and showed me this screen, this work happened so fast because my internet.com internet speed is very fast it is so less nowadays people's are faster but still according to my locality, it is very fast so with this fast internet speed, all these things are very fast, so client sends a request to the server through the browser browser is the client's, that is my assistant whatever I say from the browser, he will do that he will help me from the server to bring this webpage who is managing the server, the server is managed by youtube, youtube.com is being managed by the server and some code is written inside that server which sends me this kind of code means when I write youtube.com this code comes, now how to convert this code this work is of the browser means how to show me, this work is of the browser so client says something like this hey, give me youtube.com browser says, you want youtube.com, wait I will ask from youtube.com then browser goes to the server means it sends a request to the server, it says give me youtube.com, server either will give it or will say it is not there or will say error or will say that server error happened, it is not found whatever response will be there, ideally it should be 200, there is a response code 200, with that response the browser which is there, it comes back to the client and shows this kind of page I hope this is clear to you, client, browser server, so client to the browser, browser to the server back to the client, so this is how this works, this is a little more important let me tell you once again, when you write google.com any website google.com, so client says from the browser, bring me google.com browser says, hey gurudev, you want google.com, wait I will bring it from the server, so browser goes to the server and brings google.com and gives it to you, you get google.com, now with google.com the server is all all images, all videos whatever things are there, it sends all, like these icons it sends all, the URL of these icons is also written in this code and that too the job of the browser is to display it properly, so the server sends a whole bundle to the browser sends a bundle like this, and this bundle by passing it, showing it like this is the job of the browser, now further whatever interaction the user will do with this page the browser will make additional request if I right click and inspect and then I go to the network and if I write here, Harry bhai I wrote Harry bhai, so see so many requests he sent for images and many more requests, so as you interact, similarly more requests will have to be sent additionally to the browser, so in total, you can consider it like a restaurant, you gave an order that is, you sent a request, as soon as you gave an order, a waiter took your order, the waiter then went inside the kitchen, he sent your order to the kitchen kitchen you can consider as a server and after this, finally when the kitchen gave the order back, so what did this waiter do who is doing the job of the browser that waiter saw you back, the order may not be able to be made in the kitchen for some reason, it happens very less that you order something and you did not get it, but it happens sometimes, similarly here too sometimes it happens that you get to see an error, 404 error or 500 error, server is not working, such errors so whenever such errors are seen then also you are told, but ideally 200 means you get a response and you get such a webpage, so you can consider it like a restaurant so whenever you write google.com slash mail, so if google.com slash mail is available, then it will show you, and if you write codewithari.com slash contact so codewithari.com slash contact if available then it will show you, if not available then it will show you 404 or if there is 500 error, then it will show you a page with 500, whatever server will send, it will show you, so this cycle keeps on going, client sent a request, browser then sent the server, then the server processed the request, then the server sent the data back to the browser and whatever data was sent, browser showed it to the client then client did something browser sent the same request to the server then server sent something, whatever data was sent by the server, it came back to the client through the browser and so on so now you will say, all this is fine but what is this backend, what is the meaning of backend backend is, how the server is processing the request, now if you have a blog there is a lot of data in the blog so what will you do, you will store every webpage of the blog separately or you will dynamically generate the content, you will dynamically generate the content, let me take the example of google if i search harry bhai then you can see here that the header of google, these are the links this format doesn't change at all, if i write here shubham, ok let's say i wrote shubham here, so as soon as i write shubham, now see when i wrote harry bhai, i can see a similar content of google so what does google do, the server of google the backend of it backend processes the data in a way that it can send this kind of html for the corresponding query means when i write shubham, it will send this when i write harry bhai it will send this, so the process of generating this thing through which system is happening, that is the backend now this backend can be jango this backend can be flask, this backend can be nodejs, this backend can be php, this backend can be ruby on rails, and the database inside the backend is used means the backend code is not visible to the client this is the frontend code which is sent by the server and how the server made this code, we don't know, because this code is running on the server, if you are confused, then don't be confused at all, you will understand all these things, we will see the backend later, now we understand how the frontend works the frontend is primarily made up of three languages html, css and javascript these three are the languages which are needed if you are making a website, every website needs html, css, javascript in most of the cases if you only use html, then it becomes a basic skeleton of the website after that when you use css then you can style it, like this button looks like this, so it is only visible because of css, along with that this button is red here, or this button looks a little curvy, all this is happening with the help of css the edges you can see here are all happening with the help of css so the work of css is to style a page, what color will be the button what will happen by hovering, all these work is done through css, in a way beauty of css is html page, html is the existence, the body of any page something like this, this is a standard which is agreed, if anyone makes a website then it will be made on html, so that the browser makers can understand how to parse the work of the browser is to parse the html, and html is a skeleton, this is a standard anyone who will make a website in this world will make it in html, skeleton will use html, this is a standard this standard is made so that everyone can make the same type of pages and if anyone is making a browser then the same language has to be parsed if as a beginner you have learned 80% html then you are good to go for web development now directly some things happen with html like if I show you write a very quick html code so I am writing html code in this way, by hitting the exclamation mark I have used the emmet abbreviation you don't worry at all how I have written this code, I will write hey this is html and I can open this html file directly in this way, and as soon as I open this html file directly here you see it will open like this, I can open it directly by double clicking here and it opened, now see hey this is html written here, but it is not styled at all means this html file is very basic, now you can run videos directly from html I have a html file which I show you with which you can run videos I do one thing, I show you this html file so that we can show videos in it so html has a video tag, if you hit enter then whatever video you put in src it will be played, like if I put video 1.mp4 here, you see vscode automatically showed me video this is the benefit of using vscode so you see here I will reload it so here this video is automatically shown I can play it, to play it I have to write controls here and I will refresh it now, so I will get the controls to play it, I can play it now if I put here video 2.mp4, I put here video 1, outside I have two more videos I have some more videos here if I put it here and after this I will refer them if I put video 2.mp4 instead then video 2 will be seen, I will reload it and show you these were the lookalikes of Ben Stokes now if I put here video 3, like I put here video 3 so my third video will be played so I will reload it and you see I can play it so this is our third video I put here video 3.mp4 so I will close it and in the same way we can play video 4 and video 4 is a DJ video in which DJ is played so you see so you can make these things only by using html, means you don't need to do anything else you can play videos only with html you can display images, all this can be done only with html now if you want to style it like I want to have a border or this should be in red color background so what I have to do for that for that I have to use CSS, CSS adds beauty on any website then comes JavaScript which adds interaction for example what will happen when I click on search what will happen when I write code with Harry like code with HR and here auto complete came, many things why it came, it came because a request went to server and for this query auto complete results came so all these things are done by javascript we call this client side scripting, means if we want to do scripting in client or if we want to do coding only on client side, then we can do it with the help of javascript, this is brain so our website becomes beauty with brain I am talking about website beauty with brain, CSS adds beauty and brain comes from javascript now javascript helps you to make page dynamic easily, like without loading page, if you want to change content then all this work is done by javascript many mosquitoes are coming here, so let me kill them oh, they are mosquitoes nothing is happening here my racket is working oh my god, like the video because I eat current snacks for you when I was in college, someone told me that you have to learn HTML, CSS, javascript first learn 100% HTML then learn 100% CSS, till you learn all the properties, then learn javascript but this assumption is wrong why it is wrong, because HTML you learn only 80% and CSS you learn only 40-60% and javascript you learn only 50-70% you can start web development you can make projects and while making you can move ahead in this course, I will tell you about chat gpt and what is the impact of chat gpt so we will talk about this also you stay tuned so never run after perfection with HTML, CSS, don't think that I will do HTML for one year, then CSS then in third year I will do javascript then in fourth year I will make projects, don't think like this do HTML learn 80% HTML, learn 40-60% CSS and learn javascript learn 50-70% you can make a great website and as you make website your experience will teach you more HTML more CSS, more javascript and you will not even know that you have perfected HTML, CSS, javascript while you are making money and working as a professional web developer so you are earning along with learning and along with that you are also improving your skills so don't think that I will make website only if I know all HTML tags only if I know all CSS properties only if I know all javascript I will teach you only that that matters, we are going to learn what matters, and I don't want you to learn only for years, so I have designed this course like this so that you can learn only what matters and you can learn other things from practice and I am going to teach you many practices in this course here to learn sigma web development there are few mosquitoes, which is good so we will learn HTML first then CSS, then javascript and I will teach you tricks which you have not heard and I have learned many tricks from my career, I will teach you in this course only, I have learned some amazing tricks in my career and I want you to learn all tricks from the beginning now if you have any doubt in this course in the coming videos, you can use hashtag doubt and ask your doubt I will try to answer all the doubts I will try, I will try my best that your doubts get solved so if you have any question, you can use hashtag doubt and please don't use hashtag doubt in useless questions or comments you can write them without hashtag doubt so that I can prioritize the reply of hashtag doubt comments I will try to answer all the doubts as much as I can, and you will learn everything in this course so like this course if you have not done it that will bring a smile on my face so do it now what is react, next.js, angular so all these front end frameworks help you to use javascript properly HTML, CSS, Javascript make a website, help to make this process fast how? we will learn it in this course yes, we will learn in this course yes, we will learn in this course I told you that I will make this course completely different, I will make you from zero to hero in web development you can buy your own chair because you have bought the ticket of sigma web development express I want to give you a good analogy to teach HTML, CSS, Javascript HTML is just like car skeleton then we paint it, so CSS and internal engine car so that is Javascript as an example of a human skeleton is HTML then skin and everything is CSS and brain is the nervous system now I will take you to Forbes.com as soon as you go to Forbes a website is opened Forbes.com is a website which uses HTML, CSS and Javascript just like any other website, now if I right click on inspect, then see this inspect element is opened now see here in head they have used script and to add CSS they have used link now I will remove CSS from here to remove CSS, I will clear all the style tags using delete key as soon as I remove all the style tags and all the link tags as soon as I delete all the style sheets see the condition of this page this page is only has raw HTML what should be the size of images what kind of images should be there and only raw HTML is written here which is not styled so the condition of Forbes.com is like this without CSS without CSS, it is only showing raw buttons raw text raw links and similarly, by removing the script tag I can see how this website will look without Javascript now if I delete the HTML tag of this page like this I have deleted the head and everything so it becomes a blank page without HTML, it is not even present so this is the role of HTML, CSS and Javascript in making a web page for your information, this course was initially made to be paid but I changed my mood and converted it into a free course and I thought I will upload it on YouTube so I want you all to be serious many people have reached out to me to launch a paid course but I felt that this course should be kept free because when I was learning web development I can understand when you don't have a good course to learn and you don't have affordability to buy a paid course so I can understand and I decided that this is a SIGMA web development course and it should be launched absolutely free this course is free but as you all will earn crores of rupees in the coming time you all will give me tea, coffee, parties and all the gift feeds this is our agreement in this video so when you start earning crores and lakhs after this course then send me a green leaf or maybe a red leaf but you have to do this only when you start earning well so just keeping you aside in the next video I will tell you how you can earn money after completing this course I will put light on this because this is also important how to get a job, how to earn money how I do freelancing how clients come I will tell you everything A to Z I want to tell you some action items the first action item is to access this course's playlist which I will give you in the description everyone bookmark that playlist here press the star button and save it many of you said that the course is paid thank you so much for all the support and whatever you show me love and trust, it gives me courage but this course is going to be free now technical issues should not come I am putting all these videos in a resolution above 1080p so you should see it clearly but many people say that the video is in SD 240p, 144p you see the video and finish the internet and then you say that your videos are not HD call a municipality so I hope you understood what is request, what is response how all these websites work we got a basic idea how client-server interaction happens in the coming videos we will see how the website is made we are going to make our first website in the next video so access the playlist thank you so much for watching and I will see you next time Thanks for watching Thanks for watching"}
